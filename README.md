# Sales-Report-Generator
This is my dummy project.
This is a dummy project where I created synthetic data using ChatGPT and designed multiple tables based on the Star Schema data modeling approach. I developed a fully interactive Power BI dashboard with various slicers and buttons for enhanced user navigation and functionality.

The report consists of four pages:

1. Main Page: Includes three KPI tiles to display key metrics and three buttons for seamless navigation to the other detailed pages.
2. Detailed Pages: Each of the three remaining pages provides in-depth analysis using a variety of visualizations, such as line charts, pie charts, and bar charts, to present insights 
   effectively.
